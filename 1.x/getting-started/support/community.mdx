We’re here to help you get the most out of Lunar. Whether you need quick answers from the community or dedicated
assistance from our team, we offer multiple ways to get support for your Lunar-powered project.

## Community Support

Lunar is an open-source project, and we have an active community of developers who are happy to help. If you’re looking
for general advice or troubleshooting tips, try the following:

🗣️ [Discord Community](https://discord.gg/v6qVWaf) – Join the discussion, ask questions, and collaborate with other
Lunar users.

🔍 [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/lunarphp/lunar/discussions) – Browse existing topics or start a new
discussion about features and issues.

🐛 [Bug Reports](https://github.com/lunarphp/lunar/issues) – Found a bug? Report it on our GitHub repository so we can
improve Lunar.

Community support is a great way to get help from other developers and contributors, though response times may vary.

If you need dedicated expertise or hands-on project support, explore the Lunar Alliance — a network of trusted partners
who work alongside us to help you deliver with confidence.
