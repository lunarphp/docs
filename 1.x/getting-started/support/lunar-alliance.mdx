Working together to build the future of Laravel e-commerce

The Lunar Alliance is a collective of trusted agencies and independent developers who work alongside the Lunar team to
deliver world-class e-commerce experiences.

Members of the Alliance share our values of craftsmanship, transparency, and innovation — helping businesses of all
sizes get the most out of the Lunar ecosystem. Whether you need implementation support, a custom integration, or ongoing
technical partnership, the Alliance is here to help.

### Why the Alliance exists

Lunar’s vision has always been bigger than a single product — it’s a growing ecosystem.
The Alliance exists to:
- Connect merchants and developers with experienced Laravel e-commerce experts
- Strengthen the open-source community through collaboration and shared knowledge
- Ensure consistent quality and best practices across real-world Lunar projects

Each Alliance member is independently operated but closely aligned with Lunar’s principles and technical roadmap.

### How it works
- You choose your partner — work directly with an Alliance member suited to your project.
- You stay in control — each partner manages their own pricing, process, and delivery.
- We stay connected — the Lunar core team collaborates regularly with Alliance members to share feedback, insights, and early access to new features.
