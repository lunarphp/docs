The Inertia + Vue Starter Kit is our upcoming full-featured Lunar storefront built on Laravel + Inertia.js + Vue 3.

It’s designed for developers who want the flexibility and interactivity of a single-page application while keeping the
simplicity of Laravel’s server-side stack.
Compared to the Livewire Starter Kit, this version will be considerably more complete, providing a fully realised
front-end experience from day one.

## What to Expect

The kit includes everything you need to launch a production-ready storefront quickly — without starting from scratch:
- Fully built product catalogue, cart, and checkout flows
- Optimised SSR (Server-Side Rendering) for SEO and performance
- Tailwind CSS–based components styled with Lunar’s design system
- Dynamic account area, order history, and customer authentication
- Example implementations for payments, shipping, and taxes
- Clean, extensible architecture ready for custom logic and UI components

This kit goes far beyond a bare-bones starter — it’s a solid foundation for production stores, client builds, and premium projects.

## Release Timeline

The Inertia + Vue Starter Kit is currently in active development and is planned for release early 2026.
We’re taking time to refine it based on real-world use cases and ensure it sets a new standard for Laravel e-commerce development.

## Pricing

The price of the Starter Kit is still to be decided — but its value is clear.

What it delivers will normally take weeks of development, testing, and refinement to achieve. By starting with it, you’ll skip the groundwork and move straight to building your store.

It’s a launchpad, not a starting line.
