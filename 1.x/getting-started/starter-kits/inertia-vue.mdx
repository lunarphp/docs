The Inertia + Vue Starter Kit is our upcoming full-featured Lunar storefront built on Laravel + Inertia.js + Vue 3.

It’s designed for developers who want the flexibility and interactivity of a single-page application while keeping the
simplicity of Laravel’s server-side stack.
Compared to the Livewire Starter Kit, this version will be considerably more complete, providing a fully realised
front-end experience from day one.

## What to Expect

The kit includes everything you need to launch a production-ready storefront quickly — without starting from scratch:
- Fully built product catalogue, cart, and checkout flows
- Optimised SSR (Server-Side Rendering) for SEO and performance
- Tailwind CSS–based components styled with Lunar’s design system
- Dynamic account area, order history, and customer authentication
- Example implementations for payments, shipping, and taxes
- Clean, extensible architecture ready for custom logic and UI components

This kit goes far beyond a bare-bones starter — it’s a solid foundation for production stores, client builds, and premium projects.

## Release Timeline

The Inertia + Vue Starter Kit is currently in active development and is planned for release early 2026.
We’re taking time to refine it based on real-world use cases and ensure it sets a new standard for Laravel e-commerce development.

## Access for GitHub Sponsors

The Inertia + Vue Starter Kit will be available exclusively to Lunar GitHub Sponsors.
Sponsorship helps fund ongoing Lunar development, documentation, and ecosystem growth — including tools like this that make building with Lunar faster and more enjoyable.
