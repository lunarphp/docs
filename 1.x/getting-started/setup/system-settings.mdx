## Configuration

Lunar comes with a number of configuration files to define how Lunar functions.

You can publish these configuration files by running the following command...

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=lunar
```

Each of the settings is explained in the relevant section of the Lunar documentation.


## Set-up

When you first install Lunar you will want to set it up to match your regional requirements, e.g.

- Languages
