title: "Lunar Roadmap"
---

## Introduction

Lunar’s goal has always been simple — to be the most flexible, modern e-commerce foundation for Laravel developers.
Our roadmap evolves continuously as we refine our vision, collaborate with the community, and push the limits of what’s
possible in Laravel commerce.

Below is our current direction — as always, subject to change as we learn and grow.

---

## November 2025

#### Filament v4 Support
A complete upgrade to support Filament v4, including plug-in usage.

#### GitHub Sponsorship
Allowing our community to support Lunar's development and gain access to exclusive content.

---

## December - January 2026

#### Inertia.js + Vue Storefront Starter Kit
A fully-featured Inertia.js + Vue storefront boilerplate designed to help developers launch faster, with built-in
authentication, cart management, checkout flow, and account area.

Exclusively available to Lunar GitHub sponsors.

---

## February - March 2026

#### Event Hooks
Introduce a robust event hook system giving developers deeper control over key parts of the order, cart, and product
lifecycles.

#### Storefront API
Release of the Storefront API, enabling custom frontends and headless integrations with frameworks like Nuxt, Astro,
or Next.js.

## Beyond Q1 2026

#### Lunar v2.0
Major improvements to the core architecture, admin panel, and introduction of "Lunar PRO".

#### MCP Server

Early exploration into how Lunar can connect with the Model Context Protocol — paving the way for Conversational
Commerce and AI-assisted store interactions.

The MCP Server will serve as the bridge between Lunar and emerging AI ecosystems, enabling new possibilities for how
merchants and customers engage with commerce data.

#### Lunar Partners
A directory of proven freelancers and agencies available to assist on your Lunar projects.
