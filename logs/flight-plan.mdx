## Introduction

Lunar’s goal has always been simple — to be the most flexible, modern e-commerce foundation for Laravel developers.
Our roadmap evolves continuously as we refine our vision, collaborate with the community, and push the limits of what’s
possible in Laravel commerce.

Below is our current direction — shaped by our community, guided by experience, and always moving forward.

## Lunar v2

- **Laravel 13** - Full support for the latest Laravel release, dropping Laravel 11.

- **Filament v4** - Full compatibility with Filament v4, ensuring Lunar’s admin stays fast and forward-compatible.

- **Event Hooks** - A robust event system giving developers fine-grained control across orders, carts, products, and beyond.

- **Actions & Queries** - Streamline storefront development with reusable action and query classes for clean, consistent service logic.

- **Multi-Vendor Foundation** - The concept of Vendors will be introduced to support marketplace builds.

- **Marketplace** - Discover community-built add-ons or publish your own — from simple integrations to fully-featured extensions — free or paid.

- **API Guides** - Comprehensive guides for building custom API endpoints powering Nuxt, Next.js, Remix, and other modern storefronts.

- **Premium Inertia.js + Vue Storefront Starter Kit** - A production-ready Inertia.js + Vue storefront with authentication, cart, checkout, and account area — designed to help you launch faster. Available through the Lunar Marketplace.


Targeting release: March/April 2026 (after Laravel 13).

## Beyond Q1 2026

#### MCP Server

Early exploration into how Lunar can connect with the Model Context Protocol — paving the way for Conversational
Commerce and AI-assisted store interactions.

The MCP Server will bridge Lunar and emerging AI ecosystems, opening new possibilities for how merchants and customers interact with their commerce data.

#### Lunar v3

A brand-new Inertia.js admin panel to support our ambitions for performance, user experience, and next-level functionality.

The introduction of "Lunar PRO", a premium version bringing enhanced functionality to support growing and bigger stores alike.

The Filament admin screens will change to an "integration" add-on, and sit alongside other CMS integrations.
