We’re excited to announce something we know many of you have been waiting for: the Lunar Inertia.js + Vue Storefront Starter Kit.

This new starter kit is designed to help developers get a modern, production-ready storefront up and running quickly with Lunar.

## Why a Starter Kit?

When building an e-commerce project, the hardest part is often the beginning:
- Setting up the storefront architecture.
- Connecting it to the checkout and cart.
- Making sure SEO, performance, and responsive design are in place.

We’ve taken care of that setup for you. The starter kit gives you a solid foundation so you can focus on what makes your store unique, instead of reinventing the basics.

## Built with Inertia.js and Vue

The kit is powered by Inertia.js and Vue, making it feel fast and fluid out of the box. You’ll get:
- A clean, modern storefront design.
- Smooth cart and checkout flow.
- Ready-to-extend Vue components.
- Server-side rendering with Laravel + Inertia.

It’s a perfect balance of Laravel’s backend strength and Vue’s modern front-end experience.

## What’s Included

The starter kit comes with:
- Homepage, product listings, and product detail pages.
- Cart, checkout, and order confirmation flows.
- Customer account area with order history.
- Tailwind CSS styling for easy customization.
- Example tests and best-practice project structure.

## Who It’s For
- Agencies and freelancers who want to spin up Lunar stores quickly.
- In-house teams who need a professional base to build on.
- Contributors and experimenters who want to see best practices in action.

## Getting Started

The starter kit will be available from October 1st, 2025.

We’ll share installation instructions and documentation on the day of launch, along with examples to help you start customising straight away.

## What’s Next

This is just the beginning. We plan to expand the starter kit with:
- Additional checkout providers (Stripe and PayPal are already underway).
- More component patterns for common e-commerce features.
- A growing library of storefront extensions.

## Be Part of It

We’re building this starter kit to accelerate Lunar adoption and give the community a head start on projects. We can’t wait to see what you create with it.

Stay tuned for the official release announcement on October 1st — and if you’re not already on our Discord, now’s the perfect time to join.
