This month we’re excited to share a big step forward for Lunar: the release of our reusable checkout module.

Checkout is one of the most critical parts of any e-commerce project — it needs to be reliable, flexible, and easy to adapt to different business requirements. With our new module, we’re making checkout simpler to implement and easier to extend.

## A Vue-Powered Checkout

The checkout module is built with Vue, giving you:
- A smooth, responsive user experience.
- Easy customization of components and flows.
- Clean separation between front-end UI and back-end logic.

This means you can drop it into a Lunar project and have a fully functional checkout up and running quickly, while still having the freedom to adjust it for your needs.

## Payment Providers Included

Out of the box, the module comes with integrations for:
- Stripe
- PayPal

Both are ready to use, and you can switch between them or offer both without heavy setup.

## Build Your Own Integrations

Every store has unique requirements, and we know many of you will need additional payment options. That’s why the checkout module is built to be provider-agnostic.
- You can create your own provider integrations using a simple contract.
- Whether it’s Klarna, Adyen, or a regional gateway, the same module can power it.
- Providers can be shared, reused, and even published as packages for the community.

## Why It Matters
- Consistency → a standardised checkout flow across projects.
- Flexibility → plug in the payment options you need.
- Speed → less time building boilerplate, more time focusing on the customer experience.

We see this module becoming the foundation for all Lunar-powered checkouts going forward.

## What’s Next

We’re already looking ahead to:
- Adding more providers to the ecosystem.
- Expanding the checkout flow with features like address lookups, saved cards, and better validation.
- Creating guides for building custom integrations.

## Get Involved

We’d love for you to try the new checkout module and let us know what you think. If you build your own provider integration, consider sharing it with the community so others can benefit too.

Join the discussion in our Discord or on GitHub to share feedback, ideas, and showcase what you’re building.
