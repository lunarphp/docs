Hey everyone,

It’s been a busy few months for the Lunar team, and we’re excited to share where we’re heading next. Lunar v1 has already been powering some amazing projects, but we’ve been listening closely to feedback and thinking about how we can take things even further.

This month we want to give you a peek at the ideas shaping Lunar v2. Nothing is shipping yet, but we’re laying the groundwork for some big improvements.

## A Modular Future

One of the biggest changes in Lunar v2 will be a modular architecture.

Instead of shipping everything in one big package, you’ll be able to pick and choose the pieces you need — for example:
- catalog (products, collections, brands)
- inventory (stock handling)
- orders (carts, checkout, discounts)

Each module will stand alone, but they’ll all connect through shared events. That means:
- Your app can react to things like OrderPlaced or StockAdjusted.
- Custom modules and integrations become easier to build.
- You only install what your project actually needs.

This will keep Lunar lightweight for smaller builds while making it much more extendable for larger projects.

## A New Admin Experience with Inertia.js and Vue

We’ve loved what Filament has enabled in v1, but many of you have asked for a more modern, SPA-like experience. So we’re working on a dedicated Inertia.js + Vue admin panel.

This will give us:
- A faster, more fluid interface.
- A design system built with Vue components.
- More flexibility for things like dashboards, order management, and bulk operations.

We’ll be sharing early prototypes soon.

## Filament v4 Plugin

But don’t worry, we’re not leaving Filament behind.

We know many of you are committed to Filament, and that’s why we’re also working on a Filament v4 plugin. This means if you love the current workflow, you can stick with it and upgrade seamlessly.

You’ll get the same Lunar features in a familiar Filament interface, while those who want to try the new Vue admin can make that leap when they’re ready.

## What’s Next

In October we’ll be exploring:
- Prototyping the Inertia admin panel.
- Experimenting with modular events.
- Planning how the API package fits into the new ecosystem (as an optional add-on).

## Join the Journey

We’re building Lunar v2 with the same community-first approach that’s shaped everything so far.
- Have an idea for modular events?
- Want to weigh in on order states or admin workflows?
- Keen to try early builds when they’re ready?

Hop into our Discord or follow the discussion on GitHub. Your input will help shape what comes next.

That's all for this month’s Lunar Log. Thanks again for being part of the journey — the best is yet to come.
