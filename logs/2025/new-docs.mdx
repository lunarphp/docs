We’ve rebuilt the Lunar documentation from the ground up.

The mission was simple: make it faster to find what you need, clearer to understand, and easier to explore. The new docs
are powered by [Mintlify](https://www.mintlify.com/), giving you a faster interface, improved search, and smooth navigation whether you’re on desktop
or mobile.

You’ll notice a cleaner structure around the core concepts — getting started, configuration, extending Lunar — all
organized to match how developers actually build.

This launch isn’t just a redesign — it’s the foundation for the next chapter. As we approach Lunar v2, expect deeper
guides, architectural overviews, and examples from live production sites. Our goal is to make Lunar not only powerful,
but deeply understandable.

If you spot something missing or unclear, open an issue or suggest an edit — collaboration keeps this mission on course.

Welcome aboard the new Lunar docs.
